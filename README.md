# DEPRECATED: PLEASE READ

Singpass and Corppass no longer support SAML as of December 2022.
Please use [@govtechsg/singpass-myinfo-oidc-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@govtechsg/singpass-myinfo-oidc-helper) to connect via OIDC instead.

This package has been deprecated and is no longer maintained.

# spcp-auth-client

A node.js library for SingPass and CorpPass, common authentication methods
for public-facing government systems in Singapore

## Quick Start

```javascript
const SPCPAuthClient = require('@opengovsg/spcp-auth-client')

const client = new SPCPAuthClient({
  partnerEntityId: '<your partner entity id>',
  idpLoginURL: '<the SingPass/CorpPass IDP url to redirect login attempts to>',
  idpEndpoint: '<the SingPass/CorpPass IDP url for out-of-band (OOB) authentication>',
  esrvcID: '<the e-service identifier registered with SingPass/CorpPass>',
  appCert: '<the e-service public certificate issued to SingPass/CorpPass>',
  appKey: '<the e-service certificate private key>',
  appEncryptionKey: '<optional: the e-service certificate private key used for decrypting artifact response, if different from appKey>',
  spcpCert: '<the public certificate of SingPass/CorpPass, for OOB authentication>',
  extract: '<custom fn or SPCPAuthClient.extract.CORPPASS or SPCPAuthClient.extract.SINGPASS (default)>',
})

const express = require('express')

const POST_LOGIN_PAGE = '/<target-url-after-login>'

const app = express()

// If a user is logging in, redirect to SingPass/CorpPass
app.route('/login', (req, res) => {
  const redirectURL = client.createRedirectURL(POST_LOGIN_PAGE)
  res.status(200).send({ redirectURL })
})

// SingPass/CorpPass would eventually pass control back
// by GET-ing a pre-agreed endpoint, proceed to obtain the user's
// identity using out-of-band (OOB) authentication
app.route('/assert', (req, res) => {
  const { SAMLart: samlArt, RelayState: relayState } = req.query
  client.getAttributes(samlArt, relayState, (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      // Indicate through cookies or headers that an error has occurred
      console.error(err)
      res.cookie('login.error', err.message)
    } else {
      // If all is well and login occurs, the attributes are given
      // In all cases, the relayState as provided in getAttributes() is given
      const { attributes, relayState } = data

      // For SingPass, a user `name will be given
      // Refer to unit tests to infer what CorpPass will give
      const { UserName: userName } = attributes
      // Embed a session cookie or pass back some Authorization bearer token
      const FOUR_HOURS = 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000
      const jwt = client.createJWT({ userName }, FOUR_HOURS)
      res.cookie('connect.sid', jwt)
    }
    res.redirect(relayState)
  })
})

// Verify if session has been authenticated with our JWT
const isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  client.verifyJWT(req.cookies['connect.sid'], (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      res.status(400).send('Unauthorized')
    } else {
      req.userName = data.userName
      next()
    }
  })
}
app.route(
  '/protected-route',
  isAuthenticated,
  // ...
)

```
## About SingPass/CorpPass and this package
SingPass and CorpPass are identity providers to provide a single set of login
credentials for Singapore residents and Singapore-based corporate entities
respectively. They are both based on [SAML 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0),
and interact with service providers through HTTP Artifact Binding. The artifact returned
by the identity provider is a SAML Assertion consisting of attributes concerning the user.

What the attributes actually are depends on the identity provider:
 * SingPass will return the user's NRIC as the UserName attribute
   (this is even if the user has a non-NRIC login id)
 * CorpPass will return an attribute whose name is the UEN of the
   corporate entity, and whose value is a base64-encoded payload of
   an XML document whose structure is defined in Section 4.4.3 of the
   CorpPass Interface Specification v1.5

This package is a very lightweight implementation of the above, written after
failing to find an npm package that supports artifact binding. It is meant for
those who are solely focused on using SingPass or CorpPass as a sign-in mechanism,
solely to retrieve the contents of the SAML AttributeStatement, without being
too concerned about other SAML 2.0 features.

More full-fledged SAML 2.0 implementations for node.js include:

 * @socialtables/saml-protocol
   ([GitHub](https://github.com/socialtables/saml-protocol), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@socialtables/saml-protocol)) -
   a [port](https://medium.com/social-tables-tech/why-we-wrote-yet-another-saml-library-f79dfd8d8ddd) of the Java-based Spring-Security-SAML
 * saml2-js
   ([GitHub](https://github.com/Clever/saml2), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/saml2-js)) -
   CoffeeScript implementation from [Clever](https://www.clever.com)

Note that these do not have HTTP Artifact Binding at time of writing,
but would probably accept pull requests
